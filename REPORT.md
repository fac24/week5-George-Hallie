# Report Introduction: 

The goal of this project is to build an interactive game-like thing that uses data from an API.


# Badflix

Badflix - pick the worst movie and gain(or loose) gold stars!



# User Stories:
-  User should be able to isert username;
- Query an API (e.g. the Github API, or any other fun one);
- Populate the UI with API data;
- Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
- A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars;



## Core features:

- User selects between 2 films on which they think is the least popular
- Gets correct or incorrect
- Loses star if incorrect, or gains a point if correct
- After all lives lost the high score is saved to local storage if they surpassed their current high score
- Can restart the game
- Sees old high score when using the same username

# Project learnings:
 
 We practiced a lot using React features and learned a great deal of building a game.



# Requirement analysis:

- The Lighthouse is quite happy with accesibility(97%) but the responsiveness of the game for the different devices(mobile) is still a goal.


## What features would you prioritise to build next?

- Maybe to find a better actual rating system than using the popularity value. But this definitely worked well for a quick prototype.

## Was the project a success?

- Yes a fully functioning app was made using React in a couple days, with stretch goals included!
