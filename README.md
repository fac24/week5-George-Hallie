## How to run in your local DEV environment
- clone the repo
- `cd` into really-bad-movies
- run `npm install`
- Get an api key from tmdb https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/authentication
- Create a .env file with `VITE_APP_API_KEY = {YOURAPIKEY}`
- If you can't do this we can always lend you our key :)
- run `npm run dev` to start a server and view on the localhost
